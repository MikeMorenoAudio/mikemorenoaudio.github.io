# MexSynthCo 2019

 From January 31 to February 3 I had the opportunity to give a speech about my work on the first synthesizer convention in Mexico.

 The event was hosted by the Hola Wave Store and had interesting presentations by Nick Valente from Moog and Mark Verbos from Verbos Electronics.

 Overall an excellent and enjoyable experience.
